For starting the server, either run `WebSocketServer/bin/Release/net6.0/WebSocketServer.exe` or open the `WebSocketServerProject.sln` with **Visual Studio** and start it from there.

For starting the client, go to `websocketclient` and run `serve -s build`.\
If that doesn't work, make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed and run `npm install -g serve` first.
