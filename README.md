If you are on windows you can try cloning the project and running the `Start.bat` file for starting server **and** client.

### Starting without batch file
For starting the server, either run `WebSocketServer/bin/Release/net6.0/WebSocketServer.exe` or open the `WebSocketServerProject.sln` with **Visual Studio** and start it from there.
For starting the client, go to `websocketclient` and run `serve -s build`.
